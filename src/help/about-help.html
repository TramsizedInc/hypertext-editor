  Find the project code here: <a href="https://github.com/russellbeattie/hypertext-editor">https://github.com/russellbeattie/hypertext-editor</a>. It's open source, pull up a chair and feel free to try it out and submit bug reports. Pull requests will be happily welcomed with open arms as long as you're not an idiot.

  Also, there's zero tracking in the app itself. I haven't even turned on logging on the server. When I update the app, it should update your local copy when you open it... If the app seems to suddenly refresh on you, it's working as intended, though not ideally.

 <b style="color:red">Disclaimer</b>: I wouldn't use this thing for anything important just yet, or you know, try to edit any HTML file you particularly care about. It tends to mangle markup that the app hasn't created itself. Don't say I didn't warn you.

<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>Powered by the hard work of the folks at <a href="https://github.com/tinymce/" style="font-weight:bold">TinyMCE</a>, plus a bunch of hours of my own work trying to figure out why the hell they wrapped all the standard DOM APIs and what I needed to do to make it play nice. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>Plus I slapped in <a href="https://github.com/codemirror">CodeMirror</a> for the code bits. It's still not working correctly, but looks pretty.</p>
<p>Thanks to whoever it is who made this: <a href="https://github.com/Alyw234237/md-wysiwyg-editor">https://github.com/Alyw234237/md-wysiwyg-editor</a>. It was super helpful in showing me how some of the wonky bits worked.</p>
<p>Also thanks to the Google dev relations guys for the file stuff here: <a href="https://googlechromelabs.github.io/text-editor/">https://googlechromelabs.github.io/text-editor/</a>.
