<h1>Images, Media and Embedding</h1>
<h2>Why are my images broken?</h2>
<p>If you try to enter a link to an image, media and other file stored locally on your computer relative to your document, it won't be viewable while editing because of browser engine security protections. Though if you save the document and then open the file in your web browser, it will work as expected (if the relative URL is entered correctly.)</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold;">Solutions:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>1. The first solution is to include images from websites using the absolute URL like: https://example.com/test.png .</p>
<p>2. The second option is that you can embed the image inside the document itself by clicking the "upload" button:&nbsp; <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyNCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNCIgZm9jdXNhYmxlPSJmYWxzZSI+PHBhdGggZD0iTTE5IDRhMiAyIDAgMCAxIDIgMnYxMmEyIDIgMCAwIDEtMiAyaC00di0yaDRWOEg1djEwaDR2Mkg1YTIgMiAwIDAgMS0yLTJWNmMwLTEuMS45LTIgMi0yaDE0Wm0tOCA5LjQtMi4zIDIuM2ExIDEgMCAxIDEtMS40LTEuNGw0LTRhMSAxIDAgMCAxIDEuNCAwbDQgNGExIDEgMCAwIDEtMS40IDEuNEwxMyAxMy40VjIwYTEgMSAwIDAgMS0yIDB2LTYuNloiIGZpbGwtcnVsZT0ibm9uemVybyI+PC9wYXRoPjwvc3ZnPg==" alt=""> in the images dialog box next to the "Source" input box. (That's how the previous image was included in this document). The editor will convert the image into textual data that can be stored directly in the page. This will make the markup of the page messy and the file size larger, but has the benefit of always being viewable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. You can start a small web server on your desktop and serve the folder where your HTML document will be saved. To use this server, open the Tools â†’ Preferences dialog box and enter the local web server address (see below) into the "Local Server" input field. The document will then use that server as the base address for any relative URLs such as images or media.</p>
<p>The simplest way to run a local web server is to use Python. If you are on Windows, you will need to install it from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. Mac users will have it pre-installed, and Linux users will figure it out, I'm sure.</p>
<p  style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">Open the Command Prompt / Terminal app, and change to your documents directory (e.g. cd Documents). Then run the following:&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 1.5rem;"><code>python3 <span>-m</span> http.server</code></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">Your local server will start serving your documents at <a href="http://localhost:8000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:8000/&nbsp;</a></p>
